        <StoryTitle>THE COLLECTED WRITINGS of PAULO BONILLA</StoryTitle>

        <h4>PROLOGUE</h4>
        <Paragraph>I know this get might be boring, but I have no choice. I will try my best to make this book interesting.
        To be honest, I don’t really read that much. Sometimes I write a free-write stories and journals but this time I have to be more creative.
        I will write a story based on what I learned throughout the semester. One of the characters is Anders Breivik. He was one of the topic we
        discussed in class, English 97. Along with the characters. We have an assignment to write about the crazy person that we met.
        I met Trevor at the LACC campus and he is one of my friend. I think it will be more interesting if I include his story in my book.</Paragraph>
        <p>***</p>
        <Paragraph><i>“People get manipulated or brainwashed in different ways. It could be done by either the person you know, your friend,
        someone you trust, or the media. In our modern society, the media is everywhere and is inevitable. This technological advancement
        can be useful; it molds our perceptions about what is right and wrong and it affects our values and decisions. However, this can
        also have negative effects on its audience. What you see, hear, or read on media outlets can be one of the reason why people get
        manipulated so easily.”</i></Paragraph>
        <h1>CHAPTER ONE</h1>
        <Paragraph>It’s Fall Semester 2016! What a great season to start school!…but not really. I’m Paulo but most of my friends call me Pau.
        This semester, I met this guy at school and let me call him Trevor. Trevor is a nice guy. He likes to talk to everyone.
        Trevor dresses up like a nerd. He loves playing video games. He wears big rounded glasses. For an everyday look, he usually wear
        graphic t-shirts with quotations or a design of his favorite movies like Star Wars with a sweater on it. He always wears long pants.
        Trevor has curly black hair, brown eyes, and he is fat. Every time I call his name, he just stares at me for three or five seconds
        before he responds, and he always responses “Hmm?”. Trevor does a lot of crazy and weird stuff. For example, he acts like a kid as
        he demonstrates to me and my friends his knowledge about Kung Fu and Taekwondo. He imitates the Power Rangers. Also, he does anything
        you ask. He just does it. Crazy right?</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>Trevor is a quiet and smart guy. I heard from Trevor that he spent a lot of years at LACC taking a lot of courses.
        He also knows a lot of languages, but sometimes he really does crazy and weird things and acts like a kid.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>At first, I think that it is really hard to know about what’s going on in his head. I don’t know if he is crazy because
        sometimes I can talk to him like a normal person. However, most of the times he is not. This is the interesting part. Trevor knows
        how to read palms. All of a sudden, he will ask me if I want him to read my future through my palm, “Do you want me to read your future?”,
        Trevor whisper and asked me in a deep voice, even though I don’t believe in that. The way he holds my hand is weird because he has shaky and
        rough hands. While Trevor is talking to me, he stared at me in a strange way. He tells me about my career, how I am going to be successful,
        how I can find my true love through the person that I really hate of, about friendship, and more.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>The other day, we went to the Student Union waiting for our friends. While we’re waiting, Trevor was just standing besides me
        like a mannequin and asked me, “Do you like video games?”. I know that Trevor is addicted to video games, “No..No I don’t.” I replied.
        Trevor keeps on talking about his favorite games, World of Warcraft and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>After a week, I noticed that Trevor was getting bored hanging out with us because he wanted to be with those gamers like him.
        Especially at school. He neglected his studies. No word. No sign. He just left us behind and dropped his classes.</Paragraph>

        <h1>CHAPTER TWO</h1>
        <Paragraph>Trevor neglected his studies and he doesn’t want to go back on school. He engaged himself more on playing video games.
        Trevor did not tell his parents that he quit school. One night, Trevor went home pass his curfew. “Why did you come home late?!”
        His parents asked angrily. "I do not want to study anymore. It’s been months! I’m not showing up at school.” Trevor replied.
        His parents got mad and grounded him. Trevor has been grounded for a month.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>At night, Trevor received an email from one of his classes. He opened it, THIS WEEK'S ASSIGNMENT IS ABOUT MAKING A BLOG…ALL
        ABOUT THE THINGS THAT YOU’RE PASSIONATE ABOUT, a letter from the email. Trevor was so angry to his parents because of the restrictions
        of playing video games. He wrote about the games that he had played. Including all his resentment to the people claiming that playing
        video games is aimless and worthless, including his parents.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>After a week, Trevor met Anders Breivik through online computer war games. They have been playing for weeks. Breivik emailed
        Trevor because of Trevor’s blog. “Hey! I saw your blog. Like you, I have the same feeling.” Breivik said. Anders Breivik is a clear
        thinker, planner, and a writer. Breivik was influenced and brainwashed by online activities. Breivik spent an entire year separated
        from society playing games for hours. In addition, Breivik practiced his shooting guns using a "holographic aiming device" on the war s
        imulation game using the computer game Call of Duty: Modern Warfare. The game consists of many different tasks and some of these tasks
        can be compared with an attack. With the influence of the game World of Warcraft he thought he was a knight, saving his country, Europe.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>Days have passed, Breivik and Trevor became a close friend. Trevor sees himself with Breivik. Since Trevor and Breivik
        have the same point of view on life, they understand each other, but Trevor seemed hesitant to do something bad but Breivik is the
        who peer pressures him to do something bad. Trevor doesn’t know that Breivik is psychotic.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>One day something has changed with Breivik. He had an idea that he wants to make those video games become real. “Hey Trevor!
        Let’s make this game become realistic!” Breivik told Trevor with a convincing voice. Trevor was surprised on what Breivik said. Trevor
        thought that he was just joking around but Breivik became serious. “Are you serious?!” Trevor replied with a nervous voice. Breivik
        wanted to kill somebody with Trevor. It’s peer pressure. Breivik’s brainwashing and trying to manipulate Trevor to join him.</Paragraph>

        <h1>CHAPTER THREE</h1>
        <Paragraph>Just like last month, Trevor still didn't attend to his classes. Trevor and I are seatmates because we used to hang out.
        During class I noticed Trevor was looking from a distance and all of a sudden he started talking about Breivik. All that he has
        been talking about is how good Breivik is. Trevor also told me that he wanted to be like him so he follows all what Breivik says.
        “We’re planning to kill somebody, I’m sorry Pau.” Trevor continued in an undertone voice. “What did you say?” I asked. Then Trevor
        left without saying anything.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>That moment I felt Trevor has changed and he became really serious about what he said. It seems like he was brainwashed by Breivik.
        It connects with our discussion earlier about “Why do people get brainwashed so easily” by Gazmo Watson. People usually follow a person they
        love and admire. In that way, most people think what they hear is always right. Watson explains why people get brainwashed so easily.
        He argues it is because most people form a group and seek for people to join them that make their beliefs stronger.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>I agree that people get easily brainwashed, a point that needs emphasizing since so many people always believe what they hear and see.
        The media is really good at manipulating people. It has the power to control what we have to buy, what we eat, or what we wear everyday.
        Also, it give us information about what is true or false. For example, two big companies are using the media to compete with each other
        by comparing which is better, Samsung phones or Apple phones.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>“It’s 6:40pm. My class is over. Finally, I can go home.”</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>As I walked in the place without much light and extremely quiet. I am not afraid because I'm used to that every night I had to walk home.
        Suddenly I walk slow because I saw a big man leaning the side of the pole. Looking at me. I was afraid but I did still continue on my way.
        The big man tried to block my path, but I turn around and go back and find another way. When I turned around, I got surprised. “Trevor is that you?”
      asking in a nervous voice. As he walk slowly and the light spot on his face, it’s Trevor.</Paragraph>

        <h1>CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
        <Paragraph>I do not know why Trevor was acting weird but this time he had change. I thought Trevor was a nice guy. When I saw him,
        I looked at his eyes and I can tell that he's full of anger inside. “What’s wrong Trevor? What happened?” I asked carefully and
        I slowly walked towards Trevor. “Stop. Please don’t move.” Trevor muttered. “We can talk…we can…we can talk about thi…” I continued
        in a nervous voice, but Trevor stopped me. “I said stop!” Trevor shouted.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>“I’m sorry about this kid but I think Trevor is done here.” Breivik said. I wondered if this was Breivik that he was
        always talking about. “Wait. Who are you?” I asked. Trevor followed, “Let me finish this Breivik before we go.”</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>Breivik took a flight to LA to pick up Trevor and booked a flight to go back to Europe. Breivik manipulated Trevor
        because he knew that Trevor hated people that thinks playing video game is worthless. Trevor believed that people think that
        playing computer games is the same as having a meaningless life. Trevor thinks that when people knew that he only plays
        computer games, his life has no meaning.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>I remember that we did not agree to each other because I don’t like video games and that’s how he met Breivik.
        Then Breivik have a list of people that he wanted to kill. Now, Breivik manipulated Trevor to join him. What Breivik did
        is he brainwashed Trevor to get angry to those who disagreed with the things they do. Trevor looked up to Breivik because
        he has the same point of view in life and they both understood each other. Trevor reminds me about the North Koreans. He
        is not far from the North Koreans when it comes in the habit.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>The North Koreans put in a lot of effort to show what they believe in, their sacrifice, and how they work together
        to produce a perfect result. North Koreans work hard, are well trained, and are positively motivated to ensure they perfect
        their routines. They faithfully serve the land they love and they truly believe in their country through their commitment
        to traditions such as Mass Games. These people are like soldiers. They dedicate themselves to work hard to protect the beautiful
        country of North Korea.</Paragraph>

        <Paragraph>I think that’s how Breivik manipulates Trevor’s mind: to just believe in one thing. Breivik made a lot of changes
        with Trevor. Now, Trevor was not afraid to hurt anybody or even to kill someone.</Paragraph>

        <h4>EPILOGUE</h4>
        <Paragraph>This story and the characters involved are just fictitious. I only wrote this book using my imagination and by
        looking at all of my past works from the start until the end. There are papers that I love and proud of and there are some
        papers that I like because of my mistakes. By rereading them, I can see all my mistakes and my improvements at the same time.
        As a student, I can see that I am learning new things and discovering new ideas. Some of my works are good, some of it are better,
        and one of them is excellent. I have experienced failing to write an essay many times too. When I wrote my essays, sometimes
        I feel like I’m in the "zone", I know what I’m doing, but then again, I still need more practice. I don’t give up.
        There’s an essay that I have wrote four times just to make it better and better after each try.</Paragraph>
